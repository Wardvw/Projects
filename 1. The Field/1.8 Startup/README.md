# Mugs & Kisses

## A Startup Project by BeCode Group 1

---

### 1. The Company

Mugs & Kisses is an independent, locally owned café located in Ghent, Belgium.
We serve various drinks, both hot and cold. We also sell wholesale products.

### 2. The Website

[Landing Page](https://becodeorg.github.io/verou-4-the-startup-group-1/)

The purpose of the website is to act as business cards for customers who will then visit the café in person, and for private and business clients who will buy bags of coffee beans at wholesale price. The online shopping option is currently under construction.
Contents include a menu, a list of coffee varieties available for purchase, a contact form and how to reach the location.
The design aims at conveying a friendly, informal feeling for café customers. The theme color is a deep green (complementary to the rich brown of coffee, often present in images). The website is responsive for mobile and tablet screens.
